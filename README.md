# Message Board Rise Of The Backend

A project I worked on few months back with Vue, Node and Express. 
But a little updated with extra features.

Tasks

# Backend

* [ ] Basic Express App
* [ ] 404 and Error Handler
* [ ] Connect to Mongo with mongoose
* [ ] CRUD functionality
* [ ] Deploy API



# Frontend
* [ ] Meh! it is just gonna be a simple old-school VanillJs maybe a little bit of bootswatch and bootstrap
